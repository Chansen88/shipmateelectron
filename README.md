# Shipmate Electron

A cross platform menu bar app that allows users to easily track shipped packages from UPS, USPS and Fedex. It is a simple AngularJS web app that uses Atom's Electron. Shipmate uses Google's API to access the end users email to populate a list of incoming packages. This is the menu bar extension.

You should be able to run the .app file that links to my heroku server that is hosting the web app. You can also run "npm start" to run the app. 

The github repository for the web app is located below.

Feel free to fork this repository and improve the application.
